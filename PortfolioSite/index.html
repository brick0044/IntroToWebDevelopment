        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="images/MyPicture.jpg" style="width:300px;" /><br>
           I am a heavy machine operator with no 
           experience in programming. 
        </p>
        <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            I have no past experiences when it comes to
            programming. I have worked for the same excavation company
            for close to ten years. I was medically discharged from the 
            Marines while in boot camp, so I have experience being in 
            stressful situations. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Softball, Golfing, Fishing, Hunting, and Learning 
            New Skills.
